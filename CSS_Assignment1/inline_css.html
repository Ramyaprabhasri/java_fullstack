    <p style="color: whitesmoke; background-color: orange; margin: 20px; padding: 35px; border: 2px solid red; font-size: medium; text-align: justify;">Inline CSS allows you to apply styles directly to individual HTML elements using the style attribute. This approach is useful for quick styling changes or when you need to apply unique styles to a single element. To use inline CSS, you include the style attribute within an HTML tag and specify the desired CSS properties and values, such as setting the text color to blue and the font size to 14 pixels for a paragraph. Inline CSS takes precedence over external and internal stylesheets, making it a powerful tool for overriding styles in specific instances. However, it is generally not recommended for large projects due to its potential to clutter the HTML code and reduce maintainability. Instead, it is best used for small, specific tasks or testing purposes. Understanding when and how to use inline CSS effectively can help you manage your web design with greater flexibility and precision.Despite its convenience, relying too heavily on inline CSS can lead to inconsistent styling across a website. It is also more challenging to update styles globally since changes need to be made individually to each element. This can be time-consuming and prone to errors. For larger projects, using external stylesheets is a more efficient and organized approach. By keeping the CSS separate from the HTML, you can ensure a cleaner codebase and easier maintenance.In addition to these considerations, inline CSS can negatively impact website performance. When browsers render pages, they parse HTML and CSS separately. Inline styles increase the size of the HTML file, potentially slowing down the loading time. Furthermore, inline CSS lacks the reusability and scalability that external stylesheets offer. </p>
